# Frontend News App

This repo is the frontend of a news application I created. The final version can be viewed at https://bbb-news.netlify.app/. The app uses React, with React-Bootstrap for certain elements, icons and styling. The CSS has been coded to enable the app to work well across all devices.

## Background

The app utilises a backend database of articles and guest user accounts created using PostegreSQL. The data is accessed by the frontend through various API endpoints. You can find the backend code in my other repository: https://github.com/bobbynagra92/be-news-api

## Setup

To set up, you can fork or clone the repo, then perform the following:

```
npm install
npm install axios
npm install react-bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom
```
